# Project Philosophy

This is a small PWA. Fight complexity at every turn.

## Do more with less

Fewer files, fewer abstractions, fewer dependencies. Before adding anything, ask: can I remove something instead?

## Build time over runtime

If a problem is about data (content, structure, formatting), solve it in the build pipeline (`scripts/book-tool.mjs`), not with runtime code. The app should receive clean, ready-to-render data.

## Fix the data, not the renderer

If the UI shows something wrong, the first instinct should be: is `book.json` or `strings.json` wrong? Fix the source, rebuild. Don't add a special case in a React component.

## No new dependencies without justification

React, i18next, Vite, and CSS are enough. Don't add a state management library, a CSS framework, or a utility library unless there is a concrete, unavoidable need.

## No new abstractions until the third time

Don't extract a hook, utility, or component "just in case". Wait until you have three real use cases.

## Keep the component tree flat

The app is: `App` -> `Landing` / `Reader` -> a few panels. Don't nest deeper without a strong reason.

## Prefer deleting code to adding code

When fixing a bug or adding a feature, look for code that can be removed as part of the change.
